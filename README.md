## Running the React App

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the React app to your local machine.

### 2. Navigate to Project Directory

Using the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the required modules listed in the `package.json` file.

### 4. Start the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server, and you will see the React app running in your default web browser.

### 5. View the App

Once the development server starts, you can view the app by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 6. Additional Information

- The app uses Bootstrap for styling, so make sure to include Bootstrap in your project dependencies.
- Ensure that the API endpoints used in the app are accessible from your environment.

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
